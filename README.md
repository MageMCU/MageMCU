I'm Jesse. I've been fascinated by the magic of modern tech. My interest is in the AVR which is a family of microcontrollers developed by Atmel, acquired by Microchip but also expanding up from the 8-bitting devices.

I did put together a rudimentary robot to study the interfacing and programming of MCUs. The reasoning behind the repository publication is to further my studies in the C++ programming language to include C++ templates along with C++ meta programming. Many in the industry would narrow the modern C++ language down by encapsulating it into a singularity called abstraction. Unfortunately, many like myself where the modern C++ abstraction is difficult to grasp. Therefore, it would be nice to hear from others on improving the code.

The bare metal programming is done on the VS Code using the PlatformIO core but keep in mind the standard tools like GNU GCC C++11 or better. The electronic circuits may be displayed when appropriate. The MCU may be linked to other devices like another MCU in a master-slave relationship along with a bi-directional communication with an experimenting computing device. The communication types are presently I2C (SPI, IoT, RF Devices with emphasize RF Serial Communications Interface, Digital Modulation Shift-Keying). Finally, the type of robot used here is a simple two wheeled differential drive mobile agent.
